#Pet Place

##Intended Audience

The story for pet place is based on my 5-year-old daughter’s interests.  She loves animals, with her three favorites being: bunnies, peacocks, and golden retrievers.  

This game will allow the player to help care for the animals using simple, math problem-solving.

##Description

Upon entering “Pet Place”, the game asks the player to help care for the animals.  The goal is to  brush the bunny, feed the  peacock, and play with the golden retriever.

##Game Play

There are 6 rooms within Pet Place.
	3 rooms with supplies
	3 rooms with animals

The step is to find the rooms with supplies.  In order to “purchase” the supply, the player must answer a simple math problem (ex: 5+4).

The player must use the correct supply item with the appropriate animal:
	bunny = brush
	peacock = bird food
	golden retriever = ball

##Winning vs. Losing

The player wins the game if she takes care of all the animals with the appropriate supply item.

The player loses if she uses the wrong item on an animal (tries to brush the peacock).
